Description:
------------

Last.Mod records logins and logouts on your bot's party line. With the 
'.last' command you can see who was on, from which remote host at which 
time (and how long he/she was there).

Installation:
-------------

Last.Mod will work with eggdrop1.6.x only. 

The following instructions assume, ~/eggdrop1.6/ is the directory
where you installed your eggdrop from. (of course, other source dirs
will work as well)
Unfortunately, you need to compile last.mod within your eggdrop source,
so if you removed your original compile directory, you'll have to
compile the whole bot again... sorry.

(Note: replace X.Y.Z with your actual last.mod version number)
Put last.mod.X.Y.Z.tar.gz in ~/eggdrop1.6/src/mod/,
and unpack it (tar xfz last.mod.X.Y.Z.tar.gz). Change directory
back to ~/eggdrop1.6/. Type 'make config'. Type 'make', wait until 
compiling is done and use 'make install' to install the bot and last.mod.

TCL vars:
---------
last-max-lines - set the number of lines to show if -n NUM/-NUM was not
                 given
                 Default: 20
last-wtmp-file - set the file name where the records are saved. If used,
                 this should be set before last.mod is loaded.
                 Default: Eggdrop.last


DCC commands:
-------------
.last [-n NUM|-NUM] [-t DATE] [-i] [--] [user|idx|host]
 -n NUM, -NUM - show the last NUM lines instead of the default 
 -i           - show IP instead of user@remote.example.net 
 -t DATE      - show only logins up to this date. DATE is in the format
                YYYYMMDDhhmmss, but may be shortened, all missing fields
                will be set to the beginning of that period (i.e. 
                200704     -> 20070401000000
                2007       -> 20070101000000
                2007040316 -> 20070403160000
                ... ok, I think you get the idea)
 --           - stop option parsing
 [user|idx|host] - what to search for. user and host will accept wildcards.

 ...example: '.last -n 5 Veti*' will show the last 5 logins of anyone 
               matching 'Veti*'


Other:
------

There is absolutely NO WARRANTY on this module. I do my best to make it
work properly, but if anything gets screwed up, I'm not responsible. Use
this module at your own risk.

This mod hast been written on Linux amd64 (debian etch) and is known to 
work on Linux x86 (debian sarge), Linux mips (debian etch) and IRIX 
(uname -a: IRIX64 binky 6.5 01080747 IP30 mips, with gcc 3.2.2).

If you have problems compiling and/or running this on other systems... 
please help (see below), currently I have no access to other OSs to test...

Feedback:
---------

Feel free to send feedback and bugreports, patches [*g*] to 
last.mod@ankh-morp.org. In case of problems ALWAYS report the revision 
number (found at top of file).
